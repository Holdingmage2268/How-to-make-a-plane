    <h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer:</h2>
      <p id="warning">We are not responsible for your injuries and/or damgae that you do. Please note that your plane must be under a certain weight for ypu to fly it with out a liscense. Look it up for your region</p>
    <h2 id="physics">Pricipals of Flight</h2>
      <p id="forces">The principles of flight are, <em>lift, drag, thrust,</em> and <em>weight.</em> Lift is the force of pulling something up. Thrust is the force of pushing something any direction on a horizontal plane. Drag is the force of friction in the air, The less areodynamic something is, the more force that drag will have on it. Weight is how much the force of gravity pulls on something. In order to achieve flight, the forces of lift and thrust must be strong enough to overcome the forces of weight and drag.</p>
    <h2 id="into_action">How a Plane Puts the Principals of flight Into Action</h2>
      <p id="wing_propeller">A plane has 2 main things that put the principles of flight into action. The <em>wings</em> and <em>propeller</em>. The wings are specially shaped so the that the air on top of the wings moves fast with lower pressure, and the air below moves slower with higher pressure. This cushion of high pressure air creates lift. The propeller has tilted blades that spin at high speeds driven by an internal combustion engine to pull the plane through the air.</p>

    <h2 id="controls">Controlling the Plane</h2>
      <p id="stick_peadles">To control the plane, a pilot operates a <em>control stick</em> and <em>two peadles.</em> The stick operates the <em>ailerons</em> and the <em>elevators</em> are flaps on each side of the tail of the plane. The elevators operate how high the plane is by using friction to tilt the back of the plane upwards or downwards to point the propeller and propell the plane in that direction. When the stick is pushed foward or pulled backward, the elevators move. The ailerons are two flaps on the ends of the wings. They control the planes rolls by turning one aileron up and the other down. Friction with the air then takes its toll and makes the plane roll. When the stick is moved left or right, the ailerons move. The peadles operate the <em>rudder</em> which steers the plane by catching air friction when it is turned to the side. To turn the plane, one cannot just push on the peadles and make the plane turn abrubtly. One must roll the plane in the direcion the wish to turn by moving the stick left or right.</p>
